## First challenge of the GoStack Bootcamp (Rocketseat)

### First  things first.
Just finished the module "Conceitos do NodeJS" (NodeJS Concepts). It's time to work now!

The first challenge is to create an Simple API from scractch using Express, using the concepts learned, especially Routes and Middlewares.

### The Challenge - Bootcamp GoStack Challenge 01

The original <a href="https://github.com/Rocketseat/bootcamp-gostack-desafio-01/blob/master/README.md#desafio-01-conceitos-do-nodejs">README.md</a> can be found on Rocketseat GitHub.

Anyways, it is the README.md of my repository.

### First settings

For starting i did the following steps:
- `yarn init -y` to start the project
- `yarn add express` to add Express
- `yarn add nodemon -D` to add Nodemon as Dev Dependency
- Created a script on the package.json to start nodemon with `yarn dev`
- Started the git repo and created a `.gitignore` file

Ok. Now I'm ready to really start coding.
